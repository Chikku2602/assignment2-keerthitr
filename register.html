        <h2 id="abt" > About chitradurga fort</h2>
        <p >
            The fort was built in stages between the 11th and 13th centuries by the dynastic rulers of the region,
            including the Chalukyas and Hoysalas, later the Nayakas of Chitradurga of the Vijayanagar Empire.[5] The
            Nayakas of Chitradurga, or Palegar Nayakas, were most responsible for the expansion of the fort between the
            15th and 18th centuries. The fort was taken over for a short while by Hyder Ali at Chitradurga in 1779. The
            fort was captured by the British forces twenty years later, when they defeated his son Tipu Sultan.[5] The
            fort is built in a series of seven concentric fortification walls with various passages, a citadel, masjid,
            warehouses for grains and oil, water reservoirs and ancient temples. There are 18 temples in the upper fort
            and one huge temple in the lower fort. Among these temples, the oldest and most interesting is the
            Hidimbeshwara temple. The masjid was an addition during Hyder Ali's rule.[2][3][4] The fort's many
            interconnecting tanks were used to harvest rainwater, and the fort was said to never suffer from a water
            shortage
